Moreover, pressure, solar radiation, wind direction and wind speed do not have an impact on energy use according to our exploratory analysis. It is meaningless to include them in the prediction.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Gaussian Process Regression and Random Forests perform slightly better than other methods in daily chilled water prediction. However, Random Forests prediction used a larger training set and smaller test set. The training test ratio is 2.4 : 1 for Random Forests and 1.1 : 1 for other methods. Therefore, it is not a fair comparison. The accuracy of RF could be lower if using the same training and test set.\n",

Therefore, it is not a fair comparison. The accuracy of Linear Regression Prediction for hourly prediction could be lower if using the same training and test set.\n",

      "\n",
      "* If we had more time, we would like to optimize the set of features that should be included in the prediction. For example, we could include more features such as weather data of previous hour, or even previous two hours. This is because the cooling and heating process is dynamic and there might be some delay in systems' reponse to weather. We probably could also exclude some irralevant features to reduce the time cost of training a model.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* We shoudl have used the same training and test time scale. Please note that in daily prediction, for Random Forests and K-Nearest Neighbours methods, the training set is larger and the test set is smaller compared with those for other methods. In hourly prediction, the trainng to test ratio (number of training points divided by number of test points) of Linear Regression is much lower than Gaussian Process Regression. These are not <b><i>fair</b></i> comparison.\n",
